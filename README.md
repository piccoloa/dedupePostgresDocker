# dedupPostgresDocker

This is an experimental/learning project to explore using the Python
[dedupe](http://dedupe.readthedocs.org) library with PostgreSQL as well as other [examples](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples) from dedupe.io in a Docker environment.

It is not directly intended for general use but allows for a docker-compose environment to be created that includes four docker container builds and is further described in [this post](https://piccoloa.github.io/entityresolution/).
